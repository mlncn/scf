abstract = {AIMS: We assessed baseline clinical foot shape for 2939 feet of diabetic subjects who were monitored prospectively for foot ulceration. METHODS: Assessments included hammer/claw toes, hallux valgus, hallux limitus, prominent metatarsal heads, bony prominences, Charcot deformity, plantar callus, foot type, muscle atrophy, ankle and hallux mobility, and neuropathy. Risk factors were linked to ulcer occurrence and location via a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Hammer/claw toes (hazard ratio [HR] (95% confidence interval [CI])=1.43 (1.06, 1.94) p=0.02), marked hammer/claw toes (HR=1.77 (1.18, 2.66) p=0.006), bony prominences (HR=1.38 (1.02, 1.88), p=0.04), and foot type (Charcot or drop foot vs. neutrally aligned) (HR=2.34 (1.33, 4.10), p=0.003) were significant risk factors for ulceration adjusting for age, body mass index, insulin medication, ulcer history and amputation history. With adjustment for neuropathy only hammer/claw toes (HR=1.40 (1.03, 1.90), p=0.03) and foot type (HR=1.76 (1.04, 3.04), p=0.05) were significantly related to ulceration. However, there was no relationship between ulcer location and foot deformity. CONCLUSIONS: Certain foot deformities were predictive of ulceration, although there was no relationship between clinical foot deformity and ulcer location.},

abstract = {Adiposity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance are strongly implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This article reviews the mechanisms of adipose inflammation, because these may represent therapeutic targets for insulin resistance and for prevention of metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of obesity. The initial insult in adipose inflammation and insulin resistance, mediated by macrophage recruitment and endogenous ligand activation of Toll-like receptors, is perpetuated through chemokine secretion, adipose retention of macrophages, and elaboration of pro-inflammatory adipocytokines. Activation of various kinases modulates adipocyte transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and NFkappaB, attenuating insulin signaling and increasing adipocytokine and free fatty acid secretion. Inflammation retards adipocyte differentiation and further exacerbates adipose dysfunction and inflammation. Paracrine and endocrine adipose inflammatory events induce a local and systemic inflammatory, insulin-resistant state promoting meta-bolic dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Developing therapeutic strategies that target both adipose inflammation and insulin resistance may help to prevent type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the emerging epidemic of obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sensitivity to reward has been implicated as a predisposing factor for behaviors related to drug abuse as well as overeating. However, the underlying mechanisms contributing to reward sensitivity are unknown. We hypothesized that a dysregulation in dopamine signaling might be an underlying cause of heightened reward sensitivity whereby rewarding stimuli could act to normalize the system. METHODS: We used a genetic mouse model of increased reward sensitivity, the Delta FosB-overexpressing mouse, to examine reward pathway changes in response to a palatable high-fat diet. Markers of reward signaling in these mice were examined both basally and following 6 weeks of palatable diet exposure. Mice were examined in a behavioral test following high-fat diet withdrawal to assess the vulnerability of this model to removal of rewarding stimuli. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate altered reward pathway activation along the nucleus accumbens-hypothalamic-ventral tegmental area circuitry resulting from overexpression of Delta FosB in the nucleus accumbens and striatal regions. Levels of phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (pCREB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and dopamine and cyclic adenosine monophosphate regulated phosphoprotein with a molecular mass of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) in the nucleus accumbens were reduced in Delta FosB mice, suggestive of reduced dopamine signaling. Six weeks of high-fat diet exposure completely ameliorated these differences, revealing the potent rewarding capacity of a palatable diet. Delta FosB mice also showed a significant increase in locomotor activity and anxiety-related responses 24 hours following high-fat withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: These results establish an underlying sensitivity to changes in reward related to dysregulation of Delta FosB and dopamine signaling that can be normalized with palatable diets and may be a predisposing phenotype in some forms of obesity.},

Here we report on the induction of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1)-specific immune responses in healthy adult volunteers that received the multi-gene, polyvalent, DNA prime-protein boost HIV-1 vaccine formulation, DP6-001, in a Phase I clinical trial conducted in healthy adult volunteers of both genders. Robust cross-subtype HIV-1-specific T cell responses were detected in IFNgamma ELISPOT assays. Furthermore, we detected high titer serum antibody responses that recognized a wide range of primary HIV-1 Env antigens and also neutralized pseudotyped viruses that express the primary Env antigens from multiple HIV-1 subtypes. These findings demonstrate that the DNA prime-protein boost approach is an effective immunization method to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in humans, and that a polyvalent Env formulation could generate broad immune responses against HIV-1 viruses with diverse genetic backgrounds.},

abstract = {The maturation of T cells is an intricate process involving the interaction of developing thymocytes with discrete microenvironments within the thymus. Numerous studies have indicated that distinct thymic compartments provide signals required for each stage of thymocyte maturation. In this study we performed a comprehensive analysis of the expression patterns of Eph-A receptors and ephrins-A in the thymus using in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and show that expression of these molecules is highly compartmentalized. Based on these expression patterns and the known mechanisms of action of Eph receptor/ephrin interactions in other organs, these data suggest that differential Eph receptor expression on discrete subsets of thymic stromal cells may be important in establishing compartment boundaries and preventing intermingling of stromal cell subtypes. Further, together with chemotactic signals such as those provided by chemokines, regulated Eph receptor/ephrin expression on thymocytes may play a role in thymocyte migration.},

abstract = {Renal hypertrophy and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins are consistent findings in diabetic nephropathy and these processes can be halted or reversed by euglycemic control. Using DNA microarray analysis of glomerular RNA from control and diabetic rats we found that the expression levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) were increased while those of suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) and STAT5 were decreased. All of these changes were normalized by islet cell transplantation. Overexpression of SOCS2 in rat mesangial cells inhibited IGF-1-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which subsequently reduced type IV collagen and DNA synthesis, an effect due to interaction of SOCS2 with IGF-1R. Inhibition of SOCS2 overexpression by small interfering RNA suppressed IGF-1R-mediated actions by preventing phosphorylation of tyrosine 317 in the p66Shc adaptor protein; however, overexpression of either SOCS1 or SOCS3 did not affect IGF-1R signaling. Insulin directly increased STAT5 and SOCS2 expression in mesangial cells. This study shows that insulin can inhibit the mitogenic action of IGF-1 in mesangial cells by regulating STAT5/SOCS2 expression. Insulin deficiency may contribute to the mesangial expansion found in diabetes through reduced STAT5/SOCS2 expression.},

abstract = {Endocytosis of postsynaptic AMPA receptors is a mechanism through which efficiency of neurotransmission is regulated. We have genetically tested the hypothesis that synaptojanin 1, a phosphoinositide phosphatase implicated in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles presynaptically, may also function in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors postsynaptically. Electrophysiological recordings of cultured hippocampal neurons showed that miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes were larger in synaptojanin 1 knockout (KO) neurons because of an increase of surface-exposed AMPA receptors. This change did not represent an adaptive response to decreased presynaptic release in KO cultures and was rescued by the expression of wild type, but not catalytically inactive synaptojanin 1, in the postsynaptic neuron. NMDA-induced internalization of pHluorin-tagged AMPA receptors (GluR2) was impaired in KO neurons. These results reveal a function of synaptojanin 1 in constitutive and triggered internalization of AMPA receptors and thus indicate a role for phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate metabolism in the regulation of postsynaptic AMPA responses.},

abstract = {Exocytosis of synaptic vesicles is rapidly followed by compensatory plasma membrane endocytosis. The efficiency of endocytosis varies with experimental conditions, but the molecular basis for this control remains poorly understood. Here, the function of dynamin 1, the neuron-specific member of a family of GTPases implicated in vesicle fission, was investigated with high temporal resolution via membrane capacitance measurements at the calyx of Held, a giant glutamatergic synapse. Endocytosis at dynamin 1 KO calyces was the same as in wild type after weak stimuli, consistent with the nearly normal ultrastructure of mutant synapses. However, following stronger stimuli, the speed of slow endocytosis, but not of other forms of endocytosis, failed to scale with the increased endocytic load. Thus, high level expression of dynamin 1 is essential to allow the slow, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which accounts for the bulk of the endocytic response, to operate efficiently over a wide range of activity.},

Epistasis analysis showed that bar-1 and egl-5 function in parallel to previously described C. elegans immune-response pathways. Overexpression of human homologs of egl-5 modulated NF-kappaB-dependent TLR2 signaling in epithelial cells.

abstract = {Prostaglandin D(2), the ligand for the G protein-coupled receptors DP1 and CRTH2, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the allergic response in diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. This prostanoid also fulfills a number of physiological, anti-inflammatory roles through its receptor DP1. We investigated the role of PGD(2) and CRTH2 in allergic pulmonary inflammation by using a highly potent and specific antagonist of CRTH2. Administration of this antagonist ameliorated inflammation caused by either acute or subchronic sensitization using the cockroach egg antigen. Gene expression and ELISA analysis revealed that there was reduced proinflammatory cytokine mRNA or protein produced, as well as a wide array of genes associated with the Th2-type proinflammatory response. Importantly, the CRTH2 antagonist reduced antigen-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody levels as well as decreased mucus deposition and leukocyte infiltration in the large airways. Collectively, these findings suggest that the PGD(2)-CRTH2 activation axis has a pivotal role in mediating the inflammation and the underlying immune response in a T cell-driven model of allergic airway inflammation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the prevalence of, risk factors for, and prevention of hypoglycemia from the perspective of the pathophysiologic aspects of glucose counterregulation in diabetes. METHODS: This review is based on personal experience and research and the relevant literature. RESULTS: Although it can result from insulin excess alone, iatrogenic hypoglycemia is generally the result of the interplay of therapeutic insulin excess and compromised defenses against declining plasma glucose concentrations. Failure of beta-cells of the pancreas -- early in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus but later in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) -- causes loss of the first 2 physiologic defenses: a decrease in insulin and an increase in glucagon. Such patients are critically dependent on epinephrine, the third physiologic defense, and neurogenic symptoms that prompt the behavioral defense (carbohydrate ingestion). An attenuated sympathoadrenal response to declining glucose levels -- caused by recent antecedent hypoglycemia, prior exercise, or sleep -- causes hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) and thus a vicious cycle of recurrent hypoglycemia. Accordingly, hypoglycemia is infrequent early in T2DM but becomes increasingly more frequent in advanced (absolutely endogenous insulin-deficient) T2DM, and risk factors for HAAF include absolute endogenous insulin deficiency; a history of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, or both; and aggressive glycemic therapy per se. CONCLUSION: By practicing hypoglycemia risk reduction -- addressing the issue, applying the principles of aggressive glycemic therapy, and considering both the conventional risk factors and those indicative of HAAF -- it is possible both to improve glycemic control and to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in many patients.},

abstract = {Among the phospholipases A 2 (PLA 2s) are the group VI Ca (2+)-independent PLA 2s (iPLA 2s), and expression of multiple transcripts of iPLA 2 in skeletal muscle has been reported. In the present study, phospholipase activity and sequential ATP and calmodulin affinity column chromatography analyses reveal that skeletal muscle iPLA 2 exhibits properties characteristic of the iPLA 2beta isoform. The phospholipase activity of iPLA 2beta has been demonstrated to participate in signal transduction, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. We report here that skeletal muscle from iPLA 2beta-null mice, relative to wild-type muscle, exhibits a reduced capacity to oxidize palmitate but not palmitoyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA in the absence of changes in fatty acid transporters CD36 and CPT1 or beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. Recently, purified iPLA 2beta was demonstrated to manifest a thioesterase activity which catalyzes hydrolysis of fatty acyl-CoAs. The liberated CoA-SH facilitates fatty acid transport into the mitochondria. In this regard, we find that fractions eluted from the ATP column and containing iPLA 2beta phospholipase activity also contained acyl-CoA thioesterase activity that was inhibited by the bromoenol lactone (BEL) suicide inhibitor of iPLA 2beta. We further find that acyl-CoA thioesterase activity in skeletal muscle preparations from iPLA 2beta-null mice is significantly reduced, relative to WT activity. These findings suggest that the absence of acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of iPLA 2beta can lead to reduced fatty acyl-CoA generation and impair fatty acid oxidation in iPLA 2beta-null mice. Our findings therefore reveal a novel function of iPLA 2beta, related not to its phospholipase activity but to its thioesterase activity, which contributes to optimal fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle.},

abstract = {Islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP/G6PC2) is a major autoantigen in both mouse and human type 1 diabetes. IGRP is selectively expressed in islet beta cells and polymorphisms in the IGRP gene have recently been associated with variations in fasting blood glucose levels and cardiovascular-associated mortality in humans. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have shown that the IGRP promoter binds the islet-enriched transcription factors Pax-6 and BETA2. We show here, again using ChIP assays, that the IGRP promoter also binds the islet-enriched transcription factors MafA and Foxa2. Single binding sites for these factors were identified in the proximal IGRP promoter, mutation of which resulted in decreased IGRP fusion gene expression in betaTC-3, Hamster insulinoma tumor (HIT), and Min6 cells. ChiP assays have shown that the islet-enriched transcription factor Pdx-1 also binds the IGRP promoter, but mutational analysis of four Pdx-1 binding sites in the proximal IGRP promoter revealed surprisingly little effect of Pdx-1 binding on IGRP fusion gene expression in betaTC-3 cells. In contrast, in both HIT and Min6 cells mutation of these four Pdx-1 binding sites resulted in a approximately 50% reduction in fusion gene expression. These data suggest that the same group of islet-enriched transcription factors, namely Pdx-1, Pax-6, MafA, BETA2, and Foxa2, directly or indirectly regulate expression of the two major autoantigens in type 1 diabetes.},

We demonstrate that TNF activation of TNF receptor (R)1 stimulates both pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in the colon epithelium; however, TNFR1 protects against colon epithelial cell apoptosis following TNF exposure. To investigate anti-apoptotic signaling pathways downstream of TNFR1, we generated an intestinal epithelium-specific Raf knock-out mouse and identified Raf kinase as a key regulator of colon epithelial cell survival in response to TNF. Surprisingly, Raf promotes NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation, independent of MEK signaling, to support cell survival. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel pathway in which Raf promotes colon epithelial cell survival through NF-kappaB downstream of TNFR1 activation. Thus, further understanding of colon epithelial cell-specific TNFR signaling may result in the identification of new targets for inflammatory bowel disease treatment and define novel mediators of colitis-associated cancer.},

abstract = {The neuropeptide somatostatin (SRIF) has diverse physiological actions in the brain and endocrine organs. A family of SRIF receptors has recently been cloned that may mediate the distinct biological effects of SRIF. These receptors have a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity among themselves, but their sequences are different from any other receptors, indicating that they represent a distinct neurotransmitter receptor subfamily. The availability of the cloned receptors will now allow for detailed structure-function analysis of SRIF receptors and will facilitate development of subtype-selective agonists and antagonists that could be useful in the treatment of central nervous system and endocrine disorders.},
