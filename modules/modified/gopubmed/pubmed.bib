abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to examine in a systematic manner the influence of plasma protein binding on in vivo pharmacodynamics. Comparative pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies with four beta blockers were performed in conscious rats, using heart rate under isoprenaline-induced tachycardia as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. A recently proposed mechanism-based agonist-antagonist interaction model was used to obtain in vivo estimates of receptor affinities (K(B,vivo)). These values were compared with in vitro affinities (K(B,vitro)) on the basis of both total and free drug concentrations. For the total drug concentrations, the K(B,vivo) estimates were 26, 13, 6.5 and 0.89 nM for S(-)-atenolol, S(-)-propranolol, S(-)-metoprolol and timolol. The K(B,vivo) estimates on the basis of the free concentrations were 25, 2.0, 5.2 and 0.56 nM, respectively. The K(B,vivo)-K(B,vitro) correlation for total drug concentrations clearly deviated from the line of identity, especially for the most highly bound drug S(-)-propranolol (ratio K(B,vivo)/K(B,vitro) approximately 6.8). For the free drug, the correlation approximated the line of identity. Using this model, for beta-blockers the free plasma concentration appears to be the best predictor of in vivo pharmacodynamics.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Evaluation of response to treatment is a key aspect in cancer therapy. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) are used in most oncology trials, but those criteria evaluate only unidimensional tumor measurements and disregard the extent of necrosis, which is the target of all effective locoregional therapies. Therefore, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines recommended that assessment of tumor response should incorporate the reduction in viable tumor burden. The current report provides an assessment of the agreement/concordance between both RECIST and the EASL guidelines for the evaluation of response to therapy. METHODS:: The authors evaluated a cohort of 55 patients within prospective studies, including 24 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug eluting beads (DEB-TACE) and 31 patients who underwent percutaneous ablation (percutaneous ethanol injection [PEI]/radiofrequency [RF]). Triphasic helical computed tomography scans were performed at baseline, at 1 month, and at 3 months after procedure, and 2 independent radiologists evaluated tumor response. RESULTS:: Evaluating response according to RECIST criteria, no patients achieved a complete response (CR), 21.8% of patients achieved a partial response (PR) (none in the PEI/RF group), 47.3% of patients had stable disease (SD), and 30.9% of patients had progressive disease (PD). When response was evaluated according to the EASL guidelines, 54.5% of patients achieved a CR, 27.3% of patients achieved a PR, 3.6% of patients had SD, and 14.5% had PD. The kappa coefficient was 0.193 (95% confidence interval, 0.0893-0.2967; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS:: RECIST missed all CRs and underestimated the extent of partial tumor response because of tissue necrosis, wrongly assessing the therapeutic efficacy of locoregional therapies. This evaluation should incorporate the reduction in viable tumor burden as recognized by nonenhanced areas on dynamic imaging studies. Cancer, 2009. (c) 2008 American Cancer Society.},

abstract = {Gentamicin (GM) is used against serious and life-threatening infections, but its use is limited by the occurrence of nephrotoxicity, which involves the generation of free radicals. In this work we tested the effect of a compound with antioxidant properties, tertamethylpyrazine (TMP), a major constituent of the Chinese medicinal plant Lingusticum wallichi, on GM-induced nephrotoxicity, and compared it with an established anti-oxidant compound N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Six groups of rats were studied: (1) control, treated orally (p.o.) and intraperitoneally (i.p.) with saline; (2) treated i.p. with GM (80 mg kg(-1) per day for 6 days); (3) TMP, given p.o. (100 mg kg(-1) per day for 10 days) + GM (same dose as above during the last 6 days); (4) NAC, given i.p. (500 mg kg(-1) per day for 10 days) + GM as above; (5) TMP (100 mg kg(-1) per day for 10 days) + saline; (6) NAC (500 mg kg(-1) per day for 10 days) + saline. GM nephrotoxicity was characterized by reduced creatinine clearance, increased creatinine and urea concentrations in plasma, increased urinary excretion of N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG) and total protein. These functional and structural alterations were prevented or ameliorated by NAC treatment, while TMP had only a slight mitigating effect that was less marked than that produced by NAC. The concentration of GM in the renal cortex of the rats given GM + NAC (but not TMP) was lower than that found in rats treated with GM alone by about 25%. The mechanism by which NAC and, to a lesser extent TMP, protected against GM-induced nephrotoxicity may be related, at least in part, to the decrease in oxidative stress in renal cortex.

abstract = {Accurate DNA replication during S-phase is fundamental to maintain genome integrity. During this critical process, replication forks frequently encounter obstacles that impede their progression. While the regulatory pathways which act in response to exogenous replication stress are beginning to emerge, the mechanisms by which fork integrity is maintained at naturally occurring endogenous replication-impeding sequences remains obscure. Notably, little is known about how cells replicate through special chromosomal regions containing structured non-B DNA, for example, G4 quartets, known to hamper fork progression or trigger chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we have investigated the role in this process of the human translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases of the Y-family (pol eta, pol iota, and pol kappa), specialized enzymes known to synthesize DNA through DNA damage. We show that depletion by RNA interference of expression of the genes for Pol eta or Pol kappa, but not Pol iota, sensitizes U2OS cells treated with the G4-tetraplex interactive compound telomestatin and triggers double-strand breaks in HeLa cells harboring multiple copies of a G-rich sequence from the promoter region of the human c-MYC gene, chromosomally integrated as a transgene. Moreover, we found that downregulation of Pol kappa only raises the level of DSB in HeLa cells containing either one of two breakage hotspot structured DNA sequences in the chromosome, the major break region (Mbr) of BCL-2 gene and the GA rich region from the far right-hand end of the genome of the Kaposi Sarcoma associated Herpesvirus. These data suggest that naturally occurring DNA structures are physiological substrates of both pol eta and pol kappa. We discuss these data in the light of their downregulation in human cancers.

abstract = {Adrenergic agonists have different modulatory effects on excitatory synaptic transmission depending on the receptor subtypes involved. The present study examined the loci of alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists, which have opposite effects on excitatory neural transmission, involved in modulation of glutamatergic transmission in layer V pyramidal cells of rat cerebral cortex. Phenylephrine, an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist, suppressed the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked by repetitive electrical stimulation (eEPSCs, 10 pulses at 33 Hz). The coefficient of variation (CV) of the 1st eEPSC amplitude and paired-pulse ratio (PPR), which were sensitive to extracellular Ca(2+) concentration, were not affected by phenylephrine. Phenylephrine suppressed miniature EPSC (mEPSC) amplitude without changing its frequency. In contrast, isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, strongly increased the amplitude of the 1st eEPSC compared with that of the 2nd to 10th eEPSCs, which resulted in a decrease in PPR. Isoproterenol-induced enhancement of eEPSC amplitude was accompanied by a decrease in CV. Isoproterenol increased the frequency of mEPSCs without significant effect on amplitude. Phenylephrine suppressed inward currents evoked by puff application of glutamate, AMPA, or NMDA, whereas isoproterenol application was not accompanied by significant changes in these inward currents. These findings suggest that phenylephrine decreases eEPSCs through postsynaptic AMPA or NMDA receptors, while the effects of isoproterenol are mediated by facilitation of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals without effect on postsynaptic glutamate receptors. These two different mechanisms of modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission may improve the "signal-to-noise ratio" in cerebral cortex. Synapse 63:269-281, 2009. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest that D-amphetamine (D-AMPH) withdrawal induces a syndrome with symptoms similar to major depressive disorder (MDD). Upregulation of dynorphin (DYN) may underlie the symptoms of MDD and contribute to the negative emotional symptoms associated with psychostimulant withdrawal. Changes in the serotonin transporter (SERT) have also been reported in MDD, and changes in the immediate early gene c-fos have been observed in the context of psychostimulant withdrawal. This study examined the effects of chronic, escalating doses of D-AMPH followed by 24 h of withdrawal on the expression of prodynorphin (PD) and c-fos mRNA in limbic regions of the brain, caudate putamen (CPu), and brainstem and SERT mRNA expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated three times a day for 4 days with escalating doses of D-AMPH (1-10 mg/kg) and sacrificed 24 h after the last injection. Following 24 h of withdrawal, there was an increase in PD and c-fos mRNA expression in the CPu and nucleus accumbens (NAc), and a decrease in PD and c-fos expression in hippocampus and amygdala. SERT mRNA expression was decreased in the DRN, and PD mRNA expression was increased in the adjacent ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VLPAG) following D-AMPH withdrawal. These data indicate that region-specific changes in PD and c-fos expression occur after withdrawal, while SERT mRNA expression is suppressed, similar to what has been reported in MDD. Alterations in PD, c-fos, and SERT expression could contribute to the depression-like syndrome associated with psychostimulant withdrawal. Synapse 63:257-268, 2009. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A putative regulatory intronic polymorphism (PD1.3) in the programmed death 1 (PD-1) gene, a negative regulator of T cells involved in peripheral tolerance, is associated with increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We undertook this study to determine the expression and function of PD-1 in SLE patients. METHODS: We genotyped 289 SLE patients and 256 matched healthy controls for PD1.3 by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Expression of PD-1 and its ligand, PDL-1, was determined in peripheral blood lymphocytes and in renal biopsy samples by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. A crosslinker of PD-1 was used to assess its effects on anti-CD3/anti-CD28-induced T cell proliferation and cytokine production. RESULTS: SLE patients had an increased frequency of the PD1.3 polymorphism (30.1%, versus 18.4% in controls; P = 0.006), with the risk A allele conferring decreased transcriptional activity in transfected Jurkat cells. Patients homozygous for PD1.3-but not patients heterozygous for PD1.3-had reduced basal and induced PD-1 expression on activated CD4+ T cells. In autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions (AMLRs), SLE patients had defective PD-1 induction on activated CD4+ cells; abnormalities were more pronounced among homozygotes. PD-1 was detected within the glomeruli and renal tubules of lupus nephritis patients, while PDL-1 was expressed by the renal tubules of both patients and controls. PD-1 crosslinking suppressed proliferation and cytokine production in both normal and lupus T cells; addition of serum from patients with active SLE significantly ameliorated this effect on proliferation. CONCLUSION: SLE patients display aberrant expression and function of PD-1 attributed to both direct and indirect effects. The expression of PD-1/PDL-1 in renal tissue and during AMLRs suggests an important role in regulating peripheral T cell tolerance.},

abstract = {Chronic subordinate colony (CSC) housing has been recently validated as a murine model of chronic psychosocial stress which induces alterations of stress-related parameters including decreased body-weight gain and an increased level of anxiety in comparison with single housed control (SHC) mice. By using immunohistochemical immediate early gene (IEG) mapping we investigated whether CSC housing causes alterations in neuronal activation patterns in limbic areas including the amygdala, hippocampus, septum and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). While CSC housing increased basal Zif-268 expression in the nucleus accumbens shell compared to SHC, IEG responses to subsequent open arm (OA) exposure were attenuated in the ventral and intermediate sub-regions of the lateral septum, parvocellular PVN and the dorsal CA3 region of the hippocampus of CSC compared with SHC mice. In contrast, a potentiated c-Fos response in CSC mice was observed in the dorsomedial PAG after OA exposure. Confirming previous findings obtained on the elevated plus-maze, an enhanced anxiety-related behavior in CSC compared with SHC mice was also observed during OA exposure. In order to investigate the appropriate control conditions for CSC housing, group housed control (GHC) mice were additionally included in the behavioral testing. Interestingly, GHC as well as CSC mice showed significantly less risk assessment/exploratory behavior during OA exposure compared with SHC mice indicating that group housing itself is stressful for mice and not an adequate control for the CSC paradigm. Overall, CSC housing is an ethologically relevant chronic psychosocial stressor which results in an elevated sensitivity to a subsequent novel, aversive challenge. However, the CSC-induced increase in anxiety-related behavior was accompanied by differences in neuronal activation, compared with SHC, in defined sub-regions of brain areas known to be involved in the processing of emotionality and stress responses.},

abstract = {alpha-Synuclein (Snca) is an abundant small cytosolic protein (140 amino acids) that is expressed in the brain, although its physiological role is poorly defined. Consistent with its ubiquitous distribution in the brain, we and others have established a role for Snca in brain lipid metabolism and downstream events such as neuroinflammation. In astrocytes, Snca is important for fatty acid uptake and trafficking, where its deletion decreases 16:0 and 20:4n-6 uptake and alters targeting to specific lipid pools. Although Snca has no impact on 22:6n-3 uptake into astrocytes, it is important for its targeting to lipid pools. Similar results for fatty acid uptake from the plasma are seen in studies using whole mice coupled with steady-state kinetic modeling. We demonstrate in gene-ablated mice a significant reduction in the incorporation rate of 20:4n-6 into brain phospholipid pools due to reduced recycling of 20:4n-6 through the ER-localized long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (Acsl). This reduction results in a compensatory increase in the incorporation rate of 22:6n-3 into brain phospholipids. Snca is also important for brain and astrocyte cholesterol metabolism, where its deletion results in an elevation of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. This increase may be due to the interaction of Snca with membrane-bound enzymes involved in lipid metabolism such as Acsl. Snca is critical in modulating brain prostanoid formation and microglial activities. In the absence of Snca, microglia are basally activated and demonstrate increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Thus, Snca, through its modulation of brain lipid metabolism, has a critical role in brain inflammatory responses.},

abstract = {Astroglia are key cellular sites where opiate drug signals converge with the proinflammatory effects of HIV-1 Tat signals to exacerbate HIV encephalitis. Despite this understanding, the molecular sites of convergence driving opiate-accelerated neuropathogenesis have not been deciphered. We therefore explored potential points of interaction between the signaling pathways initiated by HIV-1 Tat and opioids in striatal astrocytes. Profiling studies screening 152 transcription factors indicated that the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) subunit, c-Rel, was a likely candidate for Tat or Tat plus opiate-induced increases in cytokine and chemokine production by astrocytes. Pretreatment with the NF-kappaB inhibitor parthenolide provided evidence that Tat+/-morphine-induced release of MCP-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by astrocytes is NF-kappaB dependent. The nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B, blocked the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NF-kappaB; causing p65 (RelA) accumulation in the nucleus, and significantly attenuated cytokine production in Tat+/-morphine exposed astrocytes. Similarly, chelating intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) blocked Tat+/-morphine-evoked MCP-1 and IL-6 release, while artificially increasing the concentration of extracellular Ca(2+) reversed this effect. Taken together, these results demonstrate that: 1) exposure to Tat+/-morphine is sufficient to activate NF-kappaB and cytokine production, 2) the release of MCP-1 and IL-6 by Tat+/-morphine are highly Ca(2+)-dependent, while TNF-alpha appears to be less affected by the changes in [Ca(2+)](i), and 3) in the presence of Tat, exposure to opiates augments Tat-induced NF-kappaB activation and cytokine release through a Ca(2+)-dependent pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lyme disease is a common vector-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), which manifests as systemic and targeted tissue inflammation. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Bb-induced inflammation is primarily host-mediated, via cytokine or chemokine production that promotes leukocyte adhesion/migration. Whether Bb produces mediators that can directly alter the vascular permeability in vivo has not been investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate if Bb produces a mediator(s) that can directly activate endothelial cells resulting in increases in permeability in intact microvessels in the absence of blood cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The effects of cell-free, spent culture medium from virulent (B31-A3) and avirulent (B31-A) B. burgdorferi on microvessel permeability and endothelial calcium concentration, [Ca(2+)](i), were examined in individually perfused rat mesenteric venules. Microvessel permeability was determined by measuring hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Endothelial [Ca(2+)](i), a necessary signal initiating hyperpermeability, was measured in Fura-2 loaded microvessels. B31-A3 spent medium caused a rapid and transient increase in Lp and endothelial [Ca(2+)](i). Within 2-5 min, the mean peak Lp increased to 5.6+/-0.9 times the control, and endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) increased from 113+/-11 nM to a mean peak value of 324+/-35 nM. In contrast, neither endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) nor Lp was altered by B31-A spent medium. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A mediator(s) produced by virulent Bb under culture conditions directly activates endothelial cells, resulting in increases in microvessel permeability. Most importantly, the production of this mediator is associated with Bb virulence and is likely produced by one or more of the 8 plasmid(s) missing from strain B31-A.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The CXCR4 chemokine receptor regulates migration and homing of cancer cells to specific metastatic sites. Determination of the CXCR4 receptor status will provide predictive information for disease prognosis and possible therapeutic intervention. However, previous attempts to localize CXCR4 using poorly characterized mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies have produced predominant nuclear and occasional cytoplasmic staining but did not result in the identification of bona fide cell surface receptors. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we extensively characterized the novel rabbit monoclonal anti-CXCR4 antibody (clone UMB-2) using transfected cells and tissues from CXCR4-deficient mice. Specificity of UMB-2 was demonstrated by cell surface staining of CXCR4-transfected cells; translocation of CXCR4 immunostaining after agonist exposure; detection of a broad band migrating at M(r) 38,000-43,000 in Western blots of homogenates from CXCR4-expressing cells; selective detection of the receptor in tissues from CXCR4+/+ but not from CXCR4-/- mice; and abolition of tissue immunostaining by preadsorption of UMB-2 with its immunizing peptide. In formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tumor tissues, UMB-2 yielded highly effective plasma membrane staining of a subpopulation of tumor cells, which were often heterogeneously distributed throughout the tumor. A comparative analysis of the mouse monoclonal antibody 12G5 and other frequently used commercially available antibodies revealed that none of these was able to detect CXCR4 under otherwise identical conditions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, the rabbit monoclonal antibody UMB-2 may prove of great value in the assessment of the CXCR4 receptor status in a variety of human tumors during routine histopathological examination.},

abstract = {Inhalation of asbestos and oxidant-generating pollutants causes injury and compensatory proliferation of lung epithelium, but the signaling mechanisms that lead to these responses are unclear. We hypothesized that a protein kinase (PK)Cdelta-dependent PKD pathway was able to regulate downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases, affecting pro- and anti-apoptotic responses to asbestos. Elevated levels of phosphorylated PKD (p-PKD) were observed in distal bronchiolar epithelial cells of mice inhaling asbestos. In contrast, PKCdelta-/- mice showed significantly lower levels of p-PKD in lung homogenates and in situ after asbestos inhalation. In a murine lung epithelial cell line, asbestos caused significant increases in the phosphorylation of PKCdelta-dependent PKD, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2/c-Jun that occurred with decreases in the BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein, Bim. Silencing of PKCdelta, PKD, and use of small molecule inhibitors linked the ERK1/2 pathway to the prevention of Bim-associated apoptosis as well as the JNK1/2/c-Jun pathway to the induction of apoptosis. Our studies are the first to show that asbestos induces PKD phosphorylation in lung epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. PKCdelta-dependent PKD phosphorylation by asbestos is causally linked to a cellular pathway that involves the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, which play opposing roles in the apoptotic response induced by asbestos.},

abstract = {The primary induced isoflavones in soybean, the glyceollins, have been shown to be potent estrogen antagonists in vitro and in vivo. The discovery of the glyceollins' ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation has led to the analysis of estrogenic activities of other induced isoflavones. In this study, we investigate a novel isoflavone, glycinol, a precursor to glyceollin that is produced in elicited soy. Sensitive and specific in vitro bioassays were used to determine that glycinol exhibits potent estrogenic activity. Estrogen-based reporter assays were performed and glycinol displayed a marked estrogenic effect on ER signaling between 1-10 microM, which correlated with comparable colony formation of MCF-7 cells at 10 microM. Glycinol also induced the expression of estrogen responsive genes (PgR and SDF-1). Competitive binding assays revealed a high affinity of glycinol for both ERalpha (IC50=13.8 nM) and ERbeta (IC50=9.1 nM). In addition, ligand receptor modeling (docking) studies were performed and glycinol was shown to bind similarly to both ERalpha and ERbeta. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that glycinol is estrogenic and may represent an important component of the health effects of soy-based foods.},

abstract = {3-Iodothyronamine (T1AM) is an endogenous compound with chemical features that are similar to thyroid hormone. T1AM has a carbon skeleton identical to that of thyroxine (T4), and contains a single carbon-iodine bond. Theoretically, T1AM could be produced from T4 by enzymatic decarboxylation and deiodination. Recent studies show that T1AM and higher iodinated thyronamines are subject to the similar metabolic processing as iodothyronines such as T4, suggesting a biological linkage between iodothyronines and iodothyronamines. In addition, single doses of T1AM administered to rodents induces a hypo-metabolic state that in certain ways resembles hibernation, and is opposite to the effects of excess T4. This review will discuss the latest developments on this recently discovered thyroid hormone derivative.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychological distress (PD) and depressive symptoms are commonly observed during menopausal transition. Studies suggest that omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids may help alleviate depression. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare enriched ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) supplementation with placebo for the treatment of PD and depressive symptoms in middle-aged women. DESIGN: Women with moderate-to-severe PD (n = 120) were randomly assigned to receive 1.05 g E-EPA/d plus 0.15 g ethyl-docosahexaenoic acid/d (n = 59) or placebo (n = 61) for 8 wk. The main outcomes were 8-wk changes in PD scores [Psychological General Well-Being Schedule (PGWB)] and depressive scales [20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale (HSCL-D-20) and the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-21)]. RESULTS: At baseline, women with PD were mildly to moderately depressed, and 24% met the major depressive episode (MDE) criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. After 8 wk, outcomes improved in both groups, but no significant differences were noted between them. Stratification analyses for MDE diagnosis at baseline indicated that differences in adjusted 8-wk changes between the E-EPA group without MDE (n = 46) and the placebo group (n = 45) were 8.0 (95% CI: 0.6, 15.3; P = 0.034) for the PGWB, -0.2 (95% CI: -0.01, -0.4; P = 0.040) for the HSCL-D-20, and -2.7 (95% CI: -0.3, -5.1; P = 0.030) for the HAM-D-21. Differences in adjusted 8-wk changes between the E-EPA group with MDE (n = 13) and the placebo group (n = 16) were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first trial of n-3 supplementation in the treatment of PD and depressive symptoms in middle-aged women. In women with PD without MDE at baseline, the 8-wk changes in PD and depressive scales improved significantly more with E-EPA than with placebo. This trial was registered at http://www.controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN69617477.},

abstract = {Monitoring Editor: Thomas Sommer The E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 mediates ubiquitination and down-regulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. AIP4 belongs to the Nedd4-like HECT domain family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which typically bind proline-rich motifs within target proteins via the WW domains. The intracellular domains of CXCR4 lack canonical WW domain binding motifs, thus whether AIP4 is targeted to CXCR4 directly or indirectly via an adaptor protein remains unknown. Here we show that AIP4 interacts directly with CXCR4 via a novel noncanonical WW domain mediated interaction involving serine residues 324 and 325 within the carboxyl terminal tail of CXCR4. These serine residues are critical for mediating agonist-promoted binding of AIP4 and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of CXCR4. These residues are phosphorylated upon agonist activation and phosphomimetic mutants show enhanced binding to AIP4, suggesting a mechanism whereby phosphorylation mediates the interaction between CXCR4 and AIP4. Our data reveal a novel noncanonical WW domain mediated interaction involving phosphorylated serine residues in the absence of any proline residues and suggest a novel mechanism whereby an E3 ubiquitin ligase is targeted directly to an activated G protein-coupled receptor.},

abstract = {Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) are sulfated polysaccharidesthat play important roles in fundamental biological processes by binding to proteins. The prototypic exampleof HSGAG-protein interactions is that with the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), specifically FGF1 andFGF2. Structural and biochemical studies have shown that the chain length, sulfation pattern, andconformation of HSGAGs play a critical role in FGF binding and activity. Previously, we showed that atetrasaccharide of the form ANS,6X-I2S-ANS,6X-I2S-OPr (where X is OH or O-sulfate and Pr is propyl) withat least one of the ANS,6X residues having a 6-O sulfate group was the minimum binding motif for FGF1[Guerrini, M., Agulles, T., Bisio, A., Hricovini, M., Lay, L., Naggi, A., Poletti, L., Sturiale, L., Torri, G.,and Casu, B. (2002) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 292, 222-230]. We report NMR structural analysisusing two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy (2D-NOESY) and transferred NOESY (trNOESY) on a non-6-O-sulfated synthetic tetrasaccharide TETRA (ANS-I2S-ANS-I2S-OPr) both in its free state and bound toFGF2. This tetrasaccharide comprises both the structural trisaccharide motif ANS-I2S-ANS that forms "kinks"in longer heparin chains induced by FGF binding [Raman, R., Venkataraman, G., Ernst, S., Sasisekharan,V., and Sasisekharan, R. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100, 2357-2362] and the common bindingmotif I2S-ANS-I2S present in octasaccharides that exhibited strong FGF2 binding [Kreuger, J., Salmivirta,M., Sturiale, L., Gimenez-Gallego, G., and Lindahl, U. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 30744-30752]. Thesedata suggest that TETRA could be the shortest HSGAG oligosaccharide that binds to FGF2. Furthermore,our study confirms that both the IdoA residues in TETRA adopt the chair 1C4 conformation upon FGF2binding to provide the best molecular fit in contrast to an analogous 6-O-sulfated tetrasaccharide motifobserved in the FGF2-HSGAG cocrystal structure where one of the IdoAs adopts skew-boat 2SOconformation. Thus, our study highlights the fact that the conformational plurality of IdoA is able toaccommodate the changes in the sulfation pattern to provide the necessary specificity for protein binding.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths in the western world. It is also resistant to most chemotherapeutic modalities. Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (PDE4is) have found applications in the treatment of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the cytotoxic effect of 2 novel PDE4is, the CC-8075 and CC-8062 compounds in pancreatic cancer cells. METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured using the sulforhodamine B protein dye. Induction of apoptosis was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Regulation of proteins and posttranslational modifications were determined using immunoblotting. RESULTS: Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with CC-8075 and CC-8062 reduces their proliferation and increases apoptosis that is caspase dependent in T3M4 cells. Furthermore, PDE4is increase phosphorylation of p38MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 3/6,MAPKYactivated protein kinase 2, Atf2, and Hsp27. The use of thep38MAPK-specific inhibitors SB202190 and SB203580 results in a modest reduction in PDE4i-induced apoptosis in T3M4 cells. Also, retinoids enhance apoptosis induced by CC-8075 and CC-8062 in GER cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the antiproliferative effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors CC-8075 and CC-8062 in pancreatic cancer cells and suggest that activation of p38MAPK signaling pathway may be associated with this process.},

The aim of this study was to find out if barley starch syrup causes allergic reactions in patients with allergy to wheat, barley, rye or oats. Fifteen children with allergy to these cereals, confirmed by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), were selected for the study. When exposed to cereals, seven of the children (47%) showed immediate type reactions, such as urticaria, rash or anaphylaxis. Eight of the children (53%) showed delayed type reactions, such as deterioration of atopic dermatitis or diarrhoea. The fifteen children with allergy to cereals were exposed to barley starch syrup in DBPCFC and none of them showed any objective signs of allergy. On skin-prick tests (SPT), five of the children (33.3%) showed a positive (>or= 3 mm) reaction to at least one of the cereals but none of them to barley starch syrup. This study confirmed with 98% confidence that at least 90% of the patients with verified allergy to cereals will not react with allergic symptoms to barley starch syrup.},

abstract = {First identified on the surface of lymphoids as a type II transmembrane protein, CD38 has now been established to have dual functions not only as a receptor but also as a multifunctional enzyme,catalyzing the synthesis of and hydrolysis of a general calcium messenger molecule, cyclic ADP-ribose(cADPR). The receptorial functions of CD38 include the induction of cell adhesion, differentiation,apoptosis, and cytokine production upon antibody ligation. Here we determined the crystal structure of calcium-loaded human CD38 at 1.45 A resolution which reveals that CD38 undergoes dramatic structural changes to an inhibited conformation in the presence of calcium. The structural changes are highly localized and occur in only two regions. The first region is part of the active site and consists of residues 121-141.In the presence of calcium, W125 moves 5 A into the active site and forms hydrophobic interactions with W189. The movement closes the active site pocket and reduces entry of substrates, resulting in inhibition of the enzymatic activity. The structural role of calcium in inducing these conformational changes is readily visualized in the crystal structure. The other region that undergoes calcium-induced changes is at the receptor region, where a highly ordered helix is unraveled to a random coil. The results suggest a novel conformational coupling mechanism, whereby protein interaction targeted at the receptor region can effectively regulate the enzymatic activity of CD38.},

MET copy number was examined in 28 NSCLC and 4 human bronchial epithelial cell lines (HBEC) and 100 primary tumors using quantitative real-time PCR. Positive results were confirmed by array comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Total and phospho-MET protein expression was determined in 24 NSCLC and 2 HBEC cell lines using Western blot. EGFR mutations were examined for exon 19 deletions, T790M, and L858R. Knockdown of EGFR with siRNA was performed to examine the relation between EGFR and MET activation. High-level MET amplification was observed in 3 of 28 NSCLC cell lines and in 2 of 100 primary lung tumors that had not been treated with EGFR-TKIs. MET protein was highly expressed and phosphorylated in all the 3 cell lines with high MET amplification. In contrast, 6 NSCLC cell lines showed phospho-MET among 21 NSCLC cell lines without MET amplification (p = 0.042). Furthermore, those 6 cell lines harboring phospho-MET expression without MET amplification were all EGFR mutant (p = 0.0039). siRNA-mediated knockdown of EGFR abolished phospho-MET expression in examined 3 EGFR mutant cell lines of which MET gene copy number was not amplified. By contrast, phospho-MET expression in 2 cell lines with amplified MET gene was not down-regulated by knockdown of EGFR. Our results indicated that MET amplification was present in untreated NSCLC and EGFR mutation or MET amplification activated MET protein in NSCLC. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {The Karyopherin proteins are involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking and are critical for protein and RNA subcellular localization. Recent studies suggest they are important in nuclear envelope component assembly, mitosis and replication. Since these are all critical cellular functions, alterations in the expression of the Karyopherins may have an impact on the biology of cancer cells. In this study, we examined the expression of the Karyopherins, Crm1, Karyopherin beta1 (Kpnbeta1) and Karyopherin alpha2 (Kpnalpha2), in cervical tissue and cell lines. The functional significance of these proteins to cancer cells was investigated using individual siRNAs to inhibit their expression. Microarrays, quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence revealed significantly higher expression of Crm1, Kpnbeta1 and Kpnalpha2 in cervical cancer compared to normal tissue. Expression levels were similarly elevated in cervical cancer cell lines compared to normal cells, and in transformed epithelial and fibroblast cells. Inhibition of Crm1 and Kpnbeta1 in cancer cells significantly reduced cell proliferation, while Kpnalpha2 inhibition had no effect. Noncancer cells were unaffected by the inhibition of Crm1 and Kpnbeta1. The reduction in proliferation of cancer cells was associated with an increase in a subG1 population by cell cycle analysis and Caspase-3/7 assays revealed increased apoptosis. Crm1 and Kpnbeta1 siRNA-induced apoptosis was accompanied by an increase in the levels of growth inhibitory proteins, p53, p27, p21 and p18. Our results demonstrate that Crm1, Kpnbeta1 and Kpnalpha2 are overexpressed in cervical cancer and that inhibiting the expression of Crm1 and Kpnbeta1, not Kpnalpha2, induces cancer cell death, making Crm1 and Kpnbeta1 promising candidates as both biomarkers and potential anticancer therapeutic targets.

In this study the mechanisms involved in E2 down regulation of BTG2 gene expression were examined. Depletion of ERalpha by siRNA indicated that the receptor is required for E2 down regulation of BTG2 mRNA levels, and cycloheximide experiments indicated that the effect of E2 on BTG2 expression was independent of intermediary protein synthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that ERalpha interacts with the BTG2 promoter in a ligand-independent fashion whereas transfection experiments indicated that ERalpha's DNA and ligand binding domains are required for E2 repression of BTG promoter activity. Surprisingly, histone deacetylase (HDACs) activity is essential for basal expression as evidenced by trichostatin A inhibition of BTG2 mRNA levels. Estradiol treatment did not alter histone H3 acetylation although it did induce displacement of RNA polymerase II from the BTG2 gene. Depletion of the ER specific corepressor REA (Repressor of Estrogen Receptor Activity) significantly abrogated E2-mediated BTG2 repression. Taken together, our results reveal a requirement of HDAC activity for basal BTG2 expression and the ERalpha-REA interaction for estrogen repression of the BTG2 gene.

abstract = {We previously developed a highly aggressive cell line from heart metastases of 4T1 breast carcinoma (designated 4THM), which produced liver metastases (designated 4TLM). In this study, gene array analysis (GAEA) compared gene expression profiles in 4TLM with profiles in 4T1 and 4THM primary tumors. GAEA demonstrated that 4T1 and 4THM tumors differed in about 250 genes. Over 1,000 genes, however, were expressed differently in 4TLM compared with primary tumors. A cohort of 16 genes showed significantly decreased expression in 4THM tumors, which decreased even further in 4TLM. Many of these genes have been implicated in breast cancer, and many are involved in cell adhesion and junctional complexes. Expression of multiple tight and adherence junction proteins was either downregulated or disappeared in 4TLM; downregulation of claudin 4, claudin 7 and gamma-catenin was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and immunocytochemical (ICC) analyses. At the protein level, intact ZO-1 was also observed in 4T1 tumors, but was not expressed in 4THM or 4TLM tumors. ICC demonstrated expression of gamma-catenin at the plasma membrane with 4T1 tumors, whereas staining appeared to be nuclear/perinuclear in 4THM tumors. Claudin 7 staining was also seen in monocyte/pmacrophage-like cells in liver around metastatic lesions by ICC, and it appeared that larger 4TLM tumors apparently reexpressed claudin 7 RNA and protein. Our results demonstrate that decreased or abnormal expression of a number of cell adhesion/junctional proteins, including claudin 4, 7, ZO-1 and gamma-catenin, correlates with liver metastases, and that cell adhesion molecules in the microenvironment are also altered.

abstract = {To establish a genetic tool for manipulating the neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) lineage in a temporally controlled manner, we generated a transgenic mouse line carrying an NSC-specific nestin promoter/enhancer expressing a fusion protein encoding Cre recombinase coupled to modified estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (ER(T2)). In the background of the Cre reporter mouse strain Rosa26(lacZ), we show that the fusion CreER(T2) recombinase is normally silent but can be activated by the estrogen analog tamoxifen both in utero, in infancy, and in adulthood. As assayed by beta-galactosidase activity in embryonic stages, tamoxifen activates Cre recombinase exclusively in neurogenic cells and their progeny. This property persists in adult mice, but Cre activity can also be detected in granule neurons and Bergmann glia at the anterior of the cerebellum, in piriform cortex, optic nerve, and some peripheral ganglia. No obvious Cre activity was observed outside of the nervous system. Thus, the nestin regulated inducible Cre mouse line provides a powerful tool for studying the physiology and lineage of NSCs. genesis 0:1-10, 2009. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to examine in a systematic manner the influence of plasma protein binding on in vivo pharmacodynamics. Comparative pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies with four beta blockers were performed in conscious rats, using heart rate under isoprenaline-induced tachycardia as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. A recently proposed mechanism-based agonist-antagonist interaction model was used to obtain in vivo estimates of receptor affinities (K(B,vivo)). These values were compared with in vitro affinities (K(B,vitro)) on the basis of both total and free drug concentrations. For the total drug concentrations, the K(B,vivo) estimates were 26, 13, 6.5 and 0.89 nM for S(-)-atenolol, S(-)-propranolol, S(-)-metoprolol and timolol. The K(B,vivo) estimates on the basis of the free concentrations were 25, 2.0, 5.2 and 0.56 nM, respectively. The K(B,vivo)-K(B,vitro) correlation for total drug concentrations clearly deviated from the line of identity, especially for the most highly bound drug S(-)-propranolol (ratio K(B,vivo)/K(B,vitro) approximately 6.8). For the free drug, the correlation approximated the line of identity. Using this model, for beta-blockers the free plasma concentration appears to be the best predictor of in vivo pharmacodynamics.

abstract = {Recombinant glycoproteins present unique challenges to biopharmaceutical development, especially when efficacy is affected by glycosylation. In these cases, optimizing the protein's glycosylation is necessary, but difficult, since the glycan structures cannot be genetically encoded, and glycosylation in nonhuman cell lines can be very different from human glycosylation profiles. We are exploring a potential solution to this problem by designing enzymatic glycan optimization methods to produce proteins with useful glycan compositions. To demonstrate viability of this new approach to generating glycoprotein-based pharmaceuticals, the N-linked glycans of a model glycoprotein, ribonuclease B (RNase B), were modified using an alpha-mannosidase to produce a new glycoprotein with different glycan structures. The secondary structure of the native and modified glycoproteins was retained, as monitored using circular dichroism. An assay was also developed using an RNA substrate to verify that RNase B had indeed retained its function after being subjected to the necessary glycan modification conditions. This is the first study that verifies both activity and secondary structure of a glycoprotein after enzymatic glycan trimming for use in biopharmaceutical development methods. The evidence of preserved structure and function for a modified glycoprotein indicates that extracellular enzymatic modification methods could be implemented in producing designer glycoproteins.

abstract = {Based on immunoblotting analyses using phospho-specific antibodies, follicle-free oocytes of the marine nemertean worm Cerebratulus sp. activate protein kinase C (PKC) when induced to mature by either seawater (SW) or cAMP-elevating drugs. In SW-stimulated oocytes, the onset of maturation (=germinal vesicle breakdown, "GVBD") can be inhibited by broadly acting PKC antagonists such as bisindoylmaleimide (BIM)-I or BIM-IX. Conversely, co-treatment with SW solutions of BIM-I or BIM-IX plus a cAMP elevator (forskolin, serotonin, or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) restores GVBD, indicating that the blockage of SW-induced GVBD by PKC antagonists is not simply due to oocyte morbidity and that such inhibition is somehow reversible by cAMP signaling. In tests to determine which specific PKC may be involved in regulating GVBD, immunoblots fail to provide strong evidence for the presence of conventional or novel PKCs, which are characteristically activated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Moreover, inhibitors of TPA-sensitive PKCs do not prevent SW-induced GVBD, and TPA itself serves to downregulate, rather than stimulate, GVBD. Alternatively, maturing oocytes apparently possess phosphorylated forms of TPA-insensitive isotypes, including an approximately 67-kDa atypical PKC and an approximately 130-kDa PKC-related kinase (PRK). Accordingly, inhibitors of atypical PKC signaling block SW-but not cAMP-induced GVBD, collectively suggesting that instead of depending on a conventional or novel isotype, SW-induced GVBD may require atypical PKC and/or PRK. In addition, such findings provide further support for the view that GVBD in nemertean oocytes can be achieved via multiple mechanisms, with SW triggering different signaling pathways than are stimulated in the presence of cAMP-elevating drugs.

abstract = {The egg envelope is a specialized extracellular matrix that surrounds and protects the oocyte and plays significant roles in animal reproductive and developmental processes. Using the NCBI digital differential display program we identified an EST sequence (XM_001340234.1) acquired from zebrafish ovary cDNA libraries in GeneBank. The full-length cDNA of this transcript was obtained by 3'and 5' RACE and further confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The full-length cDNA of the novel gene is 2,720 bp and encodes a protein of 761 amino acids. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed its expression in ovary and brain but not in other tissues. In situ hybridization demonstrates that the mRNA is transcribed in ooplasm of stage I, II, and III oocytes. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry on zebrafish ovarian sections showed that protein expression in the vitelline envelope was located to two thin positive lines in the stage III oocytes. These ovarian expression patterns show that this is a new component of the vitelline envelope that is synthesized during early developing oocytes. This protein was named ZVEP (zebrafish vitelline envelope protein) and it did not have any homology with other known vitelline envelope genes. Thus, we found that zvep is a novel gene related to the vitelline envelope in zebrafish. Mol. Reprod. Dev. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
