February 2006 : dman
-----------------
Reworked into Drupal 4.7 API, then backported to remain 4.6 compatable.
Requires forms_api_backport.module (currently at proof-of-concept stage)
Reworked the interface slightly in doing so, behavior should be consistant however.

February 2006 : dman
-----------------
- Reworked a lot to enable use as an input validator
and an output filter, as well as the original site-wrapper.
- Added a test and install function to help ensure the HTMLTidy
executable is present.
- Configured so it can optionally use an external tidy.conf file,
and so make use of all the HTMLTidy options. (like clean Word2000)
